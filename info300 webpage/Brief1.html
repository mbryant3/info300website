   <h1>History Of Nintendo</h1>
   <p>Nintendo, one of the first and oldest company that is still in the video game console business. They first entered the console making business in 1977 with color TV- game. This console was only sold in japan and sold only 3 million units. Due to the release of this console they were credited with being one of first home consoles released. </p> 
  <p>Their second release in the console market was with Nintendo Entertainment System which came out in 1983. This console sold a lot more than color TV since it wasn't just in one country. It was also very well-liked by all of users due the various of games that were on the system such as Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Final Fantasy, and many more.  This was due to the fact that they use cartridges for their games which allow them to have multiple games instead having it built in like the color TV. The popularity that came from first games in these franchises help Nintendo begin to develop the massive Fan base that exist to today. The Nintendo entertainment System or NES Sold 61.91 million units according to Nintendo Official Website.</p>
  <p>The next console Nintendo developed was Super Nintendo Entertainment System or Super NES which was released in 1991. Like their previous console, it was very well received and sold a lot but not as much NES and also used carts for games. This was probably due to competition in market with Sega Genesis, Turbografx- 16, and Neo Geo all being released in that console generation. This console generation was the most competitive out all of them due to rivalry with Sega and Nintendo. Super Nintendo was a complete upgrade in hardware compared to NES, because the games on SNES had lot more colors and better audio than NES because it had 16-bit graphics and even experiment with 3d graphics at this time. This console further expanded the Nintendo fan base with its multiple groundbreaking games such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 5 and 6, Donkey Kong Country series, Yoshi Island, and many more. Super Nintendo sold a total of 49.10 million units and was the top seller of that console generation. </p>



  <p>The next console that Nintendo sold was Nintendo 64 which was release in 1996. Like the console before it was well liked but sold less than previous installment. This was probably due to the arrival of Sony in console market and Sega still being in market at the time.  Like the previous generation, Nintendo used cartridges based storage for their games. But unlike last generation everyone else are using cd rom technology for their games because they could hold more storage than the cartridges. Other than not using the same storage technology like the others they did use 3d graphics in all their games. Which helped further expanded the gameplay in many games including the one's in their prized franchises. Nintendo 64 sold a total of 32.93 million units and came in second place in the fifth console generation.
 </p>
 <p>The next console that was sold was Nintendo GameCube which was released in 2001. Like the console before it followed the trend that Nintendo was currently facing where the next console would less than the previous. This was due that fact they made some choices that effected the development of their games such using mini DVD rom for their games which held less memory than that current industry standard of DVD- ROM which was used by Xbox, Ps2, and Dreamcast. Also, they didn't have any of the well-liked video game series of such as Call of duty or Grand theft auto because they were too violent and they were trying to give their console a family friendly image. Lastly, Sony's PlayStation 2 completely dominated this console generation in sales due to its appeal to all demographics. Even though, GameCube didn't have the third-party support like the other consoles, its major franchises were able to help console get most of its sales. Almost every time they released a game in those franchises it leads to a boost in sales. Nintendo GameCube sold a total of 21.74 million units and had 16% of the market in that console generation.</p>
 <p>The next console sold by Nintendo was Nintendo Wii which was released in 2006. The sales for this console were completely different from what they did the past. For this console, they used motion technology exclusively for all their games. This technology ended up be huge hit the media and everybody in general. There were many times on the news where they were advertising the console all time for the first five years because of Wii fit and Wii sports because they were fun and were alternatives to going to the gym. Due to all the press talking about the console which made so that everyone wanted their house. The Nintendo Wii sold a total of 101.63 million units and which made it the top seller in sixth console generation.</p>
 <h1>Nintendo Current Console</h1>
 <p>The current console that Nintendo has on the market was Nintendo Wii U which was released in 2012. This console was a complete failure for Nintendo overall. Some of the few reasons why the console failed was that was no third-party support, it was really expensive at the beginning, and it released at the wrong time.  The lack of third party support on Nintendo consoles continued from the Nintendo GameCube but unlike last time their well-known franchises were not able to save the console this time and lack of support from popular games negatively affected them. When the console was first released they sold the console at 350 dollars which were more expensive than the ps3 and Xbox 360 at that time which were being sold at 200 to 250 dollars.  The Nintendo Wii u was release at the wrong time because it was underpowered and a year later the PS4 and Xbox one were released. Which made the console look really bad since it was supposed to be their next generation console but it looks like something from previous generation. The Wii U sold a total of 13.56 million units </p>
<h1>Nintendo's Market Share </h1>
<p>The current market of share for Nintendo is 17 percent which is because the Wii u sold less consoles than PS4 and Xbox one.  Which was due to bad timing and having no support.  To improve their current market share they released the Nintendo Switch this March. The Nintendo switch made a lot of improvements so that can appeal more people than the family friendly image they were going for and upgraded their GPU so that they can get more third party support which they have been lacking for a decade. So far, the Nintendo Switch has sold 2.74 million units and is expected to sell close to total of Wii console sales which was 101.63 million units.</p>

<h1>History Of Microsoft</h1>
<p>Microsoft, the Operating system company who been around since 1975. They were mainly known for Windows, which is the most widely used Operating Systems in World. The idea of Microsoft making video console did not happen till in 1998 when four employees pitched the idea to Bill Gates. The idea they pitched was to make console like a pc but still making it widely accessibility like consoles.</p>
<p>This idea ended up turning into Microsoft Xbox which was released in 2001. The original Xbox had tons of original features, it was first console that included hard drive.  It had the highly successful Xbox live online service, an online service that many companies today use as basis for how a successful online service should work.  Along with all Xbox features, there was numerous games that Xbox had such Halo combat evolved, Halo 2, Fable, Ninja Gaiden, Star Wars: Knights of old republic, and many more. The Xbox sold a total of 24.56 million units.</p>
<p>The next console released was the Xbox 360 in 2005. The Xbox 360 made a lot of improvements on what the original Xbox did great. Xbox live was further expand on Xbox 360, they added many features that are industry standards now of days such as Achievements, Party chat, Online marketplace for game and downloadable content, skill based matchmaking, and many more. Xbox 360 was also the first console that started High definition gaming for consoles.  Microsoft also further expanded their well know franchises and created new IPs such as Gears, Forza, Crackdown, and many more. Although, the Xbox 360 made a lot of advancements it still a major problem, that plagued many of their Xbox 360 for the first 5 years called the red ring of death which made many consoles overheat and bricked. Due to this malfunction, Microsoft gave free repairs and replacements if it was unrepairable. This malfunction cost Microsoft 1.15 billion dollars and revised consoles: Xbox 360 slim/Elite were created. The Xbox 360 ended up selling a total 85.78 million units.</p>
<h1>Microsoft Current Console</h1>
<p>The current console that Microsoft released was the Xbox One which was released in 2013. When the console was first released it was bundled with the Kinetic which most people did not want at all because it was only useful to go through the console menu hands free. It was later discovered that since the kinetic was always connected to Xbox one. It was taking away graphical power from console and was later unbundled. This issue didn't help the fact that console was already underpowered when compared PlayStation 4 that is currently dominating in sales. The signs that the console is underpowered is that in fact that many of the multiplatform games that are released on both the Xbox and ps4, the ps4 version out performs in comparison to Xbox in every statistic. Which caused many people to switch consoles or avoid it in fear of getting an inferior product.   Microsoft has resolved most of the issues with Xbox one S and started taking steps towards 4k gaming and HDR in console market before Sony did.  Another reason why they losing to PlayStation is that they barely have any new exclusive games or deals like they had for Xbox 360. One big exclusive deal that Microsoft doesn't have any more that they had in the past was call of duty exclusive 30 day first access for DLC. That deal sold a lot of consoles last console generation for them and now that Sony has it, they are losing out on sales. The Xbox one has currently sold 17.98 million units</p>
<h1>Microsoft's Market Share</h1>
<p>The current market share of Microsoft is 26 percent, this is due the fact, they have lost all of the exclusive content deals they had during the 360 days to Sony this generation. Also, they don't really have any exclusive games to draw people anymore because people are starting to lose interest Halo, Gears of war, and many more because it seems like they come out every two years and nobody is surprised by them anymore. But they do have plan to resolve all the issues that Xbox one is having with their new console named Project Scorpio which is said to the most powerful console ever created. It doesn't have a release date yet but that might be revealed this June at E3. Also, they said new exclusive games are on the way instead of sequels to existing games</p>

<h1>History of Sony</h1>
<p>Sony, the second oldest company in video game console industry and the current leader in sales on Console. Before they entered the video game console market, they were electronics company made various numbers of items. They first entered the console market in 1988 when they were working on unreleased Console with Nintendo called Nintendo PlayStation which was a Super Nintendo with the ability to Play Cd –ROMS alongside cartridges that the super Nintendo used. Even though that console failed they took the experience from that to make their first console six years later.</p>
<p>That console was named the PlayStation which was released in 1994. It was the one of the first console to ever run games off CD-ROM. This format was easier to produce than the Cartridges that Nintendo used and had more memory than it too. Its only negative was that it had longer load times than the cartridges and CD-ROM drive is expensive to make.  Like every other console that released during that time, it had the ability to play games with 3d Graphics. But the console did have a lot of new ideas like having controllers with dual analog sticks which controlled the camera in the game and movement of the character, replacing the standard of having alphabet letters for the face buttons to having shapes such as squares, triangles, and circles.  Like the other companies, it had tons of memorable game franchises and Games such Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Final Fantasy 7, Mega man Legends, and many more.

<p>The next console that was released was PlayStation 3 in 2006. Sony created new disc format for High definition video that was also used in their games called Blu ray. This format allowed Sony to stop having multiple disc games on their console because Blu ray more storage than a DVD disc. When the PS3 first came out it was backwards compatible with the previous PlayStation Consoles but was dropped in next revision for the console. But they did re add it for digital downloads for PS1 and Ps2 games so that they can play on that console. This was also the first console that required the user to install their games to their hard drive, this was adopted from PC and now is industry standard for all games on current systems. The PlayStation had bit of problems sales wise when it was released because they sold it at 500 dollars which way too expensive compared to other consoles. Also, the first ps3 consoles had this problem called yellow light of death which was caused by overheating or hard drive failure which bricked the console and made it unusable. Both of these issues were resolved by later revisions for the console. Like the previous consoles, the PlayStation 3 had numerous memorable games such as Uncharted series, Resistance series, Ratchet and Clank Future Series, Killzone 2 and 3, and many more.
